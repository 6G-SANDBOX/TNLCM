# Changelog

## [v0.4.0] - 2024-10-XX

### Added

- **Concurrency** support in the Flask application by integrating Gunicorn to handle multiple simultaneous requests, improving responsiveness and performance.
- **Trial network isolation** to run several networks in parallel. The number of parallel trial networks is determined by the value of the environment variable `GUNICORN_WORKERS` minus 1. By default, `GUNICORN_WORKERS` is set to 3, allowing two trial networks to be executed concurrently.
- **Pipeline deployment check** a pipeline currently in use cannot be used to deploy a trial network, and users will receive a notification that the pipeline is already in use.
- **README** file added in the `tn_template_lib` directory to explain defined trial networks.
- **Initial CLI handler** to execute commands.
- **Git switch method** for streamlined repository management.
- **Callback model** in database for answers generated by jenkins on entity deployment.
- **Utils directory** with required functions. 
- **Scripts directory** with the following deployment scripts:
  - `deploy_vm.sh`: deploy TNLCM and MongoDB in a virtual machine.
  - `deploy_docker.sh`: deploy TNLCM and MongoDB using Docker.

### Changed

- Updated Python to version **3.13.0**.
- Updated MongoDB to version **8.0**.
- **Improved README documentation** for better clarity and usage guidelines.
- Migrated from the `ansible-vault` library to `ansible-core` since only this module is of interest.
- Renamed `ANSIBLE_VAULT` variable in `.env.template` to `SITES_TOKEN` for clarity.
- Moved the implementation from the `resource_manager` directory to the resource manager within the `models` directory.
- Rename `trial_networks`, `users` and `verification_tokens` collections to `trial_network`, `user` and `verification_token`.

### Fixed

- Resolved a bug when creating a trial network, where components were defined in the 6G-Sandbox-Sites repository but not in the 6G-Library.
- Corrected function documentation to reflect accurate information.
- The endpoint for returning repository branches now only lists branches created on the remote repository.
- Fixed message display when checking if a user can access a trial network.
