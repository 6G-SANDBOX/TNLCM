## [v0.4.0] - 2024-10-24

### Added

- **Concurrency** support in the Flask application by integrating **Gunicorn** to handle multiple simultaneous requests, improving responsiveness and performance.
- **Trial network isolation** to run several networks in parallel. The number of parallel trial networks is determined by the value of the environment variable `GUNICORN_WORKERS` minus 1. By default, `GUNICORN_WORKERS` is set to 3, allowing two trial networks to be executed concurrently. To execute sequentially, the number of `GUNICORN_WORKERS` has to be 2.
- **TNLCM folder is created in jenkins.** For each trial network its own pipeline is created to guarantee the isolation and to be able to execute several at the same time.
- **TRIAL_NETWORKS readme file** added in the `docs` directory to explain defined trial networks.
- **Initial CLI handler** to execute commands.
- **Git switch method** for streamlined repository management.
- **Callback collection** in database for answers generated by jenkins on entity deployment.
- **Utils directory** with required functions.
- **Scripts directory** with the following deployment scripts:
  - `deploy_vm.sh`: deploy TNLCM and MongoDB in a virtual machine.
  - `deploy_docker.sh`: deploy TNLCM and MongoDB using Docker.

### Changed

- Updated Python to version **3.13.0**.
- Updated MongoDB to version **8.0**.
- **Improved README documentation** for better clarity and usage guidelines.
- Migrated from the `ansible-vault` library to `ansible-core` since only this module is of interest.
- Renamed `ANSIBLE_VAULT` variable in `.env.template` to `SITES_TOKEN` for clarity.
- Moved the implementation from the `resource_manager` directory to the resource manager within the `models` directory.
- Rename `trial_networks`, `users` and `verification_tokens` collections to `trial_network`, `user` and `verification_token`.
- Rename columns `tn_state`, `tn_date_created_utc`, `tn_raw_descriptor`, `tn_sorted_descriptor`, `tn_deployed_descriptor`, `tn_report` and `tn_directory_path` to `state`, `date_created_utc`, `raw_descriptor`, `sorted_descriptor`, `deployed_descriptor`, `report` and `directory_path` in `trial_network` collection.
